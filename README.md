# JPEG Analyser

The JPEG Analyser that no one really asked for.

> I really can't think of a nicer name for this project.

## What it does (or will do once it's done):

Performs an over the top in-depth redundant analysis and data visualisation of a jpeg image that only serves to scratch the most nerdish of itches.

## Directions for use:

1. Apply JPEG directly to site.
2. Enjoy analysis
